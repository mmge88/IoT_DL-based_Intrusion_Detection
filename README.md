# IoT_DL-based_Intrusion_Detection

The project proposes an intrusion detection scheme for IoT networks that classifies traffic flow through the application of deep learning concepts. 

We adopt a newly published IoT dataset (Bot-IoT dataset) and generate generic features from the field information in packet level. We develop a feed-forward neural networks model for binary and multi-class classification including denial of service, distributed denial of service, reconnaissance and information theft attacks against IoT devices.

### Requirements
* At least Python 3.6+
* TensorFlow
* Dataset by the Cyber Range Lab of the center of UNSW Canberra Cyber: https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/bot_iot.php
